# Cpp-Matrix-of-Capacitors-Coils-and-Dimmers
Cpp project for counting matrixes, both Re and Im, of capacitors, coils and dimmers with particular properties


This project is written in object-oriented cpp.

It counts the Re and Im matrixes for capacitors, coils and dimmers with specific powers (read from file).

Project was written as additional one for Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.
One of the requirements of this projects was to make it in one file, thus each class is not written in separate files.
